# Improving Cancer Prediction by Optimizing cfDNA Error Model

Through our bachelor's project (Bachelor of Data Science), we've gotten the opportunity to work with Molekyl√¶r Medicinsk Afdeling (MOMA) to improve an aspect of the DREAMS pipeline, by utilizing same data used in the paper detailing UMIseq. Both papers can be found as 
- DREAMS: deep read-level error model for sequencing data applied to low-frequency variant calling and circulating tumor DNA detection. MBC. By Christensen et al. 2023
- Error-Corrected Deep Targeted Sequencing of Circulating Cell-Free DNA from Colorectal Cancer Patients for Sensitive Detection of Circulating Tumor DNA. MDPI. By Frydendahl et al. 2024. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of dreams from
[GitHub](https://github.com/JakobSkouPedersenLab/dreams) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JakobSkouPedersenLab/dreams")
```
