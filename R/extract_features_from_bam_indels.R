#' Correct a DNA Sequence Based on a CIGAR String
#'
#' This function corrects a DNA sequence based on a provided CIGAR string. It first expands the CIGAR string,
#' then inserts 'D's into the DNA sequence at positions corresponding to 'D's in the expanded CIGAR string.
#' It also replaces characters in the DNA sequence with 'I's at positions corresponding to 'I's in the CIGAR string.
#' After applying these modifications, the function calls `clean_insertions` to clean up the sequence.
#'
#' @param cigar A string representing the CIGAR sequence. Each character in the CIGAR string (such as M, I, D)
#' represents a type of alignment operation.
#' @param sequence A string representing the DNA sequence that needs to be corrected based on the CIGAR string.
#'
#' @return A DNA sequence string that has been corrected based on the CIGAR string. The function returns the
#' sequence after applying deletions, insertions, and further cleaning through the `clean_insertions` function.

#' Correct Number Vector Based on CIGAR String
#'
#' This function takes a CIGAR string and a vector of numbers and adjusts the numbers
#' based on the CIGAR operations. Deletions ('D') in the CIGAR string cause zeros to be inserted
#' into the number vector at the corresponding positions, and insertions ('I') cause the corresponding
#' numbers to be marked for removal. The final vector excludes these marked insertions.
#'
#' @param cigar A character string representing a CIGAR sequence.
#' @param numbers A numeric vector that corresponds to the CIGAR string and needs correction.
#'
#' @return An integer vector with corrections applied based on the CIGAR string.
#' Deletions result in zeros inserted at the appropriate indices, and insertions are removed.
