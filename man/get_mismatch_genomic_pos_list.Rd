\title{Get list of genomic positions with mismatches}
\usage{
get_mismatch_genomic_pos_list(pos, MDtag)
}
\arguments{
\item{pos}{Genomic position}

\item{MDtag}{MD tag string from the BAM file that contains information about
matches, mismatches, and deletions in the read alignment.}
}
\value{
A list of genomic positions where mismatches occur, corresponding to
each MD tag provided.
}
\description{
This function computes the genomic positions of mismatches in
sequencing reads based on the MD tag from BAM files. The MD tag describes
how the read aligns to the reference genome, including mismatches. The
function identifies these mismatches and computes their positions relative
to the start of the alignment, aiding in variant calling and analysis of
sequencing errors.
