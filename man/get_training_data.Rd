\item{bed_include_path}{String. Path to bed-file with regions to include.
Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{factor}{Number between 0 and 1. Ratio between negative and positive
data. Default is 1.}

\item{common_positions_to_exclude_paths}{Vector of strings. List of files
with positions to exclude from all samples. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{positions_to_exclude_paths}{Vector of strings. List of files with
positions to exclude from training with length equal to number of samples.
Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{mm_rate_max}{Number between 0 and 1. Maximum mismatch rate in position.
Default is 1.}

\item{verbose}{TODO: Write this}
