\title{Prepare Training Data with Indel Information}
\usage{
prepare_training_data_indels(training_data, model_features)
}
\arguments{
\item{training_data}{A data frame containing the training data.}

\item{model_features}{A vector of selected feature names to be used in the
model.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements: \code{features} containing the selected features
of the training data, and \code{labels} containing the one-hot encoded labels.
}
\description{
This function processes training data by selecting specific features and the
observed values (obs) for genomic data, including nucleotide bases and indels
(insertions 'I' and deletions 'D'). It then prepares this data for use in
machine learning models, particularly those that require categorical data to
be converted into a one-hot encoded format.
